# Generated Manifests

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The files in this folder are automatically generated by the [`build.sh`](../../../scripts/build.sh) script.

**DO NOT EDIT** these files manually as your changes will be overwritten when the script runs again.

## How these files are generated

The manifests are created using the `kn-workflow gen-manifest` command as part of the build process. The script:

1. Generates Kubernetes manifests from the workflow definition
2. Applies persistence configuration (if enabled)
3. Creates secrets and configmaps based on workflow properties

## To regenerate these manifests

Run the build script from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --image=<your-image-name>
```

For more information, see the [build script documentation](../../../scripts/README.md).
